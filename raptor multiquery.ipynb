    "# RAPTOR: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use an implementation of RAPTOR with llama-index, leveraging the RAPTOR llama-pack.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAPTOR works by recursively clustering and summarizing clusters in layers for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "There two retrieval modes:\n",
    "- tree_traversal -- traversing the tree of clusters, performing top-k at each level in the tree.\n",
    "- collapsed -- treat the entire tree as a giant pile of nodes, perform simple top-k.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18059) for full algorithm details."
